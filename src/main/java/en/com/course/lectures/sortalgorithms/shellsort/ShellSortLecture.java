    /**
     * Characteristics
     * - Is a variation of Insertion Sort
     * - Starts using a larger gap value
     * - Goal of reducing the gap as the algorithm run, so the amount required of shifgting is diminished
     * - After the run through the array, divide the gap by 2 until reaches 1
     * - Finishing all the runs, and transforming the array in a partially sorted array, becomes Insertion sort
     * - This is done because the time complexity of the insertion sort on a partially sorted array is O(n)
     * - Gap is calculated using the Knuth sequence (3^k-1)/2 where k is the length of the array
     * - The Worst case time complexity is O(nÂ²), but depends the sort.
     * - Unstable algorithm (doest not respect duplicate elements order) because of the gap
     * - Could be used to improve bubble sort also+
